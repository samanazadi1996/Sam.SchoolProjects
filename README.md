# My School Projects ðŸŽ“  

Welcome to **Sam.SchoolProjects**! This repository is a collection of projects I wrote during my school years. These codes remind me of my early days of learning programming and bring a sense of nostalgia.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  

I created this repository mainly for myselfâ€”to look back at my learning journey and remember where I started. These projects are a symbol of my passion and excitement for programming in those early days.  

> **Note:** These projects are kept as an archive and will not be updated. However, if you have any thoughts or suggestions, Iâ€™d love to hear them! ðŸ˜Š
